1: ABOUT onyx
----------------

onyx, is a blockchain protocol that extends the Bitcoin Blockchain through enabling Trustless Rewards for Engineering Sustainable Solutions.

The onyx community has set out to build a cryptographically secure blockchain protocol and Auxiliary Chain(AuxChain) that will allow for building applications that trustlessly reward sustainable solutions.

The onyx Protocol is built with game-theory that rewards machines operating in regions in the World with a high solar reliability.

Thus, the protocol will incentivize engineers in the developing World to contribute to developing sustainable solutions to challenges facing their community using the following Engineering disciplines:

Community Engineering + Software Engineering + Protocol Engineering

The onyx protocol will be supported by a suite of software tools built to incentivize multiple third-party individuals and institutions to collaborate together to execute and achieve this vision.

The onyx protocol is designed to unlock the potential of sustainable resources such as Solar Energy by enabling a distributed economy that is interoperable with the mainstream economy.

The onyx Protocol is being built, tested and deployed by a community of individuals and organizations around the World. The onyx Protocol is designed for utility and not speculative investment and therefore should accrue value with increased adoption of the Protocol.
